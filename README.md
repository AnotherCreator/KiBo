KiBo (kɪ boʊ) is a [Discord](https://discord.com/brand-new) bot that utilizes the [Hikari](https://www.hikari-py.dev/) 
API wrapper to run the bot alongside the [Hikari-Lightbulb](https://hikari-lightbulb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 
command handler for 'Slash (/)' commands. 

KiBo's key functionality at the moment is its integration with [CoinMarketCap's API](https://coinmarketcap.com/) 
to track and display the top 100 cryptocurrencies.
